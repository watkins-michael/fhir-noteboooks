    "This query activity will give examples of both forms. It will help you practice (a) building queries, and (b) parsing the resulting resources to access the data fields you need. You may need to look through the FHIR specification for a certain resource to know which fields you can query for, look through SNOMED CT or RxNorm browsers to know which codes to use for medications or conditions, or look through other terminologies as used by the FHIR resource specification.\n",
