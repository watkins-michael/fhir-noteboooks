MDCalc uses the 'Hard' coronary Framingham outcomes model, which is intended for use in non-diabetic patients age 30-79 years with no prior history of coronary heart disease or intermittent claudication, as it is the most widely applicable to patients without previous cardiac events.

There are a few resources which each represent different aspects of how medications are used in a clinical setting. They are each described in the [R4 Medications Module](http://hl7.org/fhir/medications-module.html). A MedicationRequest resource is generated when the provider creates the instruction for a patient to take a certain medication. As you can imagine, this is usually the most convenient way to see which medications a patient should be taking or should have taken at some point of time. Whether or not the patient actually takes the medication is another story. We will assume that if a MedicationRequest resource exists for a certain medication that the patient took that medication as prescribed.\n",

A ValueSet resource was created for this example and is stored in the server. It contains 5 values for possible blood pressure medications which are common to our synthetic patients.
